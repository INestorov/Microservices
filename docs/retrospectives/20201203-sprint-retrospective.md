## Main Problems Encountered:						
#### Problem 1:						
Description:  Deciding on the architecture of our microservice application.						
Reaction: Some team members were already prepared to give suggestions for architecture components, others joined on the go, and the architecture was agreed on very briskly.						
						
#### Problem 2:						
Description:  Forwarding of requests by the gateway						
Reaction: We created new requests from the incoming ones and sent them separately, waiting for a response, making the communication synchronous.
